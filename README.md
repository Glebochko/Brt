Class PBRTF
---
- In the PBRTF class, there are methods for breaking a password using bruteforce with the given possible password character values and the possible number of characters in the password. All possible password combinations are written in a separate file. 
- All combinations are tested for optimization. 
- By slightly correcting the method of outputting combinations to a file, you can optimize this task for breaking passwords with the help of Arduino boards. 
- Of course, passwords can only be cracked for research purposes.
